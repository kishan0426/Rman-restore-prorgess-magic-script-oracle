# Rman-restore-progress-magic-script-oracle

Purpose - Monitor the RMAN restore progress in oracle database

Language - Shell script

Description:
This script is written after we failed to report an approximate progress of restore to customer after a database failure. This challenge inspired me to write this script. I am not a programmer but i used to write scripts for my personal use. So this magic script would give an approximate progress of the database restore and report you in equal intervals with real time statistics of restore on the putty screen. Hope this script is useful!
